### Scientific Projects 

[Observation of Phonon Polaritons in Wafer Scale films of Hexagonal Boron Nitride prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.202302045)
<br>
These results were achieved within the framework of the EU project "Graphene Flagship CORE 3".
I wrote Python scripts to analyze infrared nanoscopy images and reflectivity spectra of the grown hexagonal boron nitride.
I found that the performance of the grown hBN are similar to the exfoliated hBN, but with the advantage of large scale and controlled thickness offered by the growth technique.
This open the possibility to employ 2D materials for mass production of photonics devices.

[Anharmonic lattice dynamics of MgO: implications for Earth and planetary science](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.054302)
<br>
These results were achieved within the framework of the National French project "Matisse".
I performed infrared spectroscopy and inelastic X-ray scattering of MgO at high pressure and high temperature in order to simulate the condition of the Earth mantle.
The results of the experiments were confirmed by _ab-initio_ simulation using Quantum Expresso. 
Then I used the simulation to extrapolate the results for pressure and temperature ranges impossible to realize in laboratory and to
calculate quantities which are difficult to measure at these thermodynamic conditions, like the thermal conductivity.

[Thermoplasmonics: generation and manipulation of nanoscale heating with metallic nanostructures](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b03808)
<br>
I used Gold nanostructures to create nanoheaters remotely operables with infrared laser beams.
I demonstrated their efficiency by heating a thin polymeric layer.
Combining infrared photoexpansion measurements and non linear COMSOL simulations, I recorded an incresement of 10 K at 20 mW of laser power.
This means that hundreds of K may be attainable with full infrared laser power.

[Nanoporous gold 3D structures for mid-infrared molecular sensing](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/nr/c6nr08231a)
<br>
I extracted the dielectric permittivity of Nanoporous Gold from infrared spectroscopy measurements, since there was no record of its optical properties in the literature.
Then, I plugged it in CST Studio Suite to simulate the size of the structures.
Finally, I fabricated the structures in cleanroom using Focused Ion Beam milling.

[Highly doped Germanium nanostructures for mid-infrared molecular sensing](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b03247)
<br>
These results were achieved within the framework of the EU project "GEMINI", which involved 5 european research groups.
We demonstrated a doping concentration exceeding 10^20 cm^-3 with transport and infrared spectroscopy measurements.
We simulated the size of linear antennas using Lumerical feeded with measured dielectric permittivity of the material.
The final structures were fabricated with Reactive Ion Etching and were employed to perform a sensing essay of hazardous substances.

<br>
I had the chance to collaborate with the galician assosiacion of mental health for the cover of the volume no 68-69.

[Radio Satellite Imagery](https://www.tabakalera.eus/es/radiofotografia-por-satelite)
<br>
I participated to the activities of the Astronomy group of the Tabakalera Media Lab and I heard about the [Open-Weather](https://open-weather.community/) project by the Sophie Dyer and Sasha Engelmann... it literally blew me away.
Sometimes the weather is cloudy and I have fun with a software defined radio dongle and a couple of bandpass filter and amplifier.

[Wheater Forecast and Light Pollution data correlation for spotting astrophotography sites](http://example.com/)
<br>
An attempt to replicate the "where2go" feature of meteoblue for spotting sites with clear and dark night skies.

[Astropine: Astroberry + Pine A64](http://example.com/)
<br>
Astropine is the result of the specific compilation of Astroberry, a system for controlling astronomy equipment, on a Pine A64 single board computer.

[GuideScope and Polar Alignement Aid Toolkit](http://example.com/)
<br>
I realized this lightweight and cheap setup using an IMX290 Sony sensor and a 6-60mm CCTV objective enclosed in a 3D printed arca-swiss compatible case.
